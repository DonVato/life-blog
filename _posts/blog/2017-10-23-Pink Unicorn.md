# I’ve been a Peace Corps Volunteer for 2+ years.

I didn’t know what that meant 27 months ago and still don’t know now. The best description I could give of my experience would be this: 

Imagine a pink unicorn. Huge and Pink AF. Imagine that same unicorn moving into your neighborhood from a magical unicorn land where there’s always Internet, vaccines are easy to get(they even have idiots who *choose* not to get them), and a  Jimmy Johns. A land you personally couldn’t fathom leaving if you ever got the chance to go.  Now imagine that pink unicorn trying to speak to you. Like, *REALLY* trying to sound intelligent, but no matter how hard he tries, he sounds like (you guessed it) an unintelligible pink unicorn. 

But after a little Rosetta Stone (Level 5), he sounds like an intelligent 8-year old. Now get this, picture this unicorn saying he’s going to teach you and everyone else about HIV, AIDS, self-esteem, nutrition, bullying, excel, and environmental awareness after just learning how to talk *(arrogant little prick)*. Now imagine him walking around the neighborhood trying to get you and other kids to come to school OUTSIDE of school hours to talk about all this information he’s learned and brought from the magical unicorn land. Or better yet, imagine him going up to your mom and saying (with his big boy Rosetta Stone words) that he’s going to teach her how to make better, healthier food, avoid infectious diseases, and manage chronic illnesses despite being a unicorn who just learned how to speak and isn’t even half your mom’s age (I’m just going to assume unicorn and human aging are comparable).

Imagine, finally, that after two years of living in the neighborhood, giving you candy and piggyback rides, cooking with your mom, playing dominoes with your dad, and fitting in, he says he has to leave. This doesn’t make sense. He’s been here for as long as you can remember. Guilt-tripping (as your neighborhood often does), you begin saying things to the unicorn like *“Why are you leaving?? Do you have to go?? When are you coming back?? Can I have your fridge? Did you even like it here? Wait, you’re actually Americ..err... I mean a unicorn? Who’s going to give us candy now? Who’s going to play with us? Will you miss us? Don’t go.”*

Imagine a neighborhood that completely forgets they were living with a pink unicorn for 2 years. – 

I did as much as I could for my community, but I also didn’t do enough. I learned how to speak Spanish, but I also didn’t have a clue what was going on half the time. I wasn’t always welcome here, but this feels like my home from home. I keep saying I’m done with big adventures, but I know this Peace Corps experience has only set me up for my biggest adventures to come. 

I don’t have the words to describe my feelings about finishing my work here. I frequently walk across busy, loud streets in towns full of crime trying to just buy cold a$$ fried chicken, forgetting I’m in another country. I absent-mindedly leave the house with doors open and return to find Dominican mothers, having locked my house with nothing taken, eager to chastise me for carelessness, but placing a free dinner in my home because they know how lazy I get with cooking. There’s a comfort I feel that could only come from 2 years of living here. There’s a deep trust built amongst my immediate community that makes me feel appreciated, a luxury many volunteers don't have. 

But I also have had those days where I couldn’t handle chaotic storm of strange things surrounding around me. *“Why did you poop on the toilet seat in the only community bathroom dude??? You're a grown-a$$ man! We all gotta sit on that and your poop is my problem now. Why are you making fun of my Spanish? I’m trying as hard as I can to get better. Why are you treating me like a second-class citizen? I look exactly like you.”*  These are the days you wish you were in the states ordering pizza, in an air-conditioned room playing FIFA with people who can only speak English. These two types of experiences feel indivisible, part of a package that can’t be separated or two sides of the same coin. I periodically reflect on the past 2 years of my life and debate if helping those who lack resources to help themselves was worth the struggle, worth the time, worth missing friends’ weddings, worth missing family members’ births, worth the hate, worth missing graduations, or worth the loneliness. Do the days at the beaches of San Rafi, the afternoons in the mountains of Constanza, or the nights walking the streets of Santo Domingo with the oddest assortment of government-issued friends I'll ever meet make the two years feel more worthwhile?

In short and simply, sure. The longer response is more of a ramble than a real answer. 

As for my Peace Corps site, I don’t know if my community will ever realize how differently I view and think about their Dominican culture, despite looking like I belong in it. I don’t know if my community will ever realize that they’ve changed how I want to live the rest of my life, despite only being a blip in many of theirs. But if I can be remembered fondly by a handful as the pink unicorn they called their clueless child or wacky uncle, their first Peace Corps Volunteer or their first glimpse of American diversity, I’d leave with no regrets.
