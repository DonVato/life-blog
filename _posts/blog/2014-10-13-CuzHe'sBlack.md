**Cuz he’s black**

Powerful piece by Javon Johnson 
Here’s the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Wf8y_5Yn4#t=35)

America’s obsession with black culture contradicts its hate of it. There’s so much appropriation of black culture from clothes, music, vernacular, and mannerisms that it’s almost, *almost*, funny why everyone seems to hate them, *us*.  
As a black American kid, you learn to grow up sooner than you’d like. You learn that your mere presence is a threat to everyone around you. You learn that you can’t do what your friends do. You learn about police brutality, racist “friends,” and ugly stereotypes. 

Talking to my mom, she asked me about the stuff that happened in Ferguson, Missouri. 
Jaded, I respond “That sucks.” She continues to explain to me that I shouldn’t stand up for myself in those situations. She explains to me that being arrested and alive is better than being proud and dead. She explains to me that my father and her cried not about Michael Brown, but that just by being alive, my fate could be the same.

I nod my head as if my mother was there with me in the room.  
I respond, “Alright, mom I’ll be careful.”  I tell her I love her and then we hang up.
