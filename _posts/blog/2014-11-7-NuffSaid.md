[Here's a link to the song I've created!!](https://soundcloud.com/tamballer/nuffsaid)


I managed to get it *DONE*!  I managed to get a song out in the wild after a couple weeks of not doing much in music production and it’s liberating to have a “finished” prototype to present.  Much like my last post, I’m going to use a formal domain of art to express my opinion. I think it gives the audience something to latch onto (an artistic product) while I get to tell my stories ((:

I chose a Clueless movie meme because (I freakin love Clueless) and I see myself in the creative art domain as being completely lost amongst savvy artists. At first you think you have everything figured out until you're start to make something. Either the melody doesn't work or your sketch doesnt make sense and through this, you end up creating more problems for yourself than you should. From a macrosopic view, alot of things seem super simple, but when you nitpick and look a bit closer, the faults are much easier to see. It's easy for other people to see how cool the things I've drawn, wrote, or created are, but sometimes when I look at something I've made, all I can see is problems! However, I still manage to enjoy what I do ((: . I thought a Clueless meme (he he matches my blog name) would be the best way to show this!


My experiment for the last 30 days was to study Artistic vs. Everyday creativity.  I wanted to understand if your everyday creativity informed your artistic ability or vice versa. I decided to participate in 3 clubs: writing club, music production organization, and a game development club. I hoped through the activities in these clubs I could create artistic products and analyze how they came about. I've posted my video game prototype and wrote about my experiences in writing, so that last thing to post should be a song!

I decided that my post-experiment reflection needed a little “something something” to give it emphasis and to drive my point home. Creativity is hard to talk about if you don’t have a creative product to talk about! This takes me to my first point.

I feel pretentious talking about creativity! I’ve always felt like that and when I tell people that I enjoy drawing, making music, or developing video games in my free time, I get the eye-rolls.  Everyone says that they dabble in whichever creative medium (even if they have nothing to show for it) and “talk is cheap.” But when I put my “artistic ability” on the line (which is entirely nerve-racking) I’ve only gained respect, despite the quality (or lack of quality) found in my work.

People naturally appreciate artistic work, but seldom try to create their own, especially past the formative years of elementary, middle, or even high school. I love that I was able to post any work I’ve done for people to see!

I decided to challenge myself for this last post. I create a lot of electronic and hip hop songs, but decided that I’d make 1 song in **5 hours.** From start to finish, I’d create a main melody, add some accompaniment rhythms, and the mix it for volume peaks.  

I wanted to conduct one last experiment that I could use for primary research.  I got my inspiration to rapidly produce a song from hackathons. Hackathons are events in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers and project managers, collaborate intensively on software projects. The projects are not allowed to be worked on prior to the event whatsoever. Hackathons typically last between 3 days and in video game circles as little as 48 hours. 5 hours to make one song shouldn't be bad right? I hoped to see if creativity could be better cultivated if there’s obstacles.

This music project represented my whole experiment quite well. When an idea for anything begins to form, you have no idea where it’s going to lead. This sounds cheesy and flimsy, but it’s been the truth in my experiences. You can even see that in the song I've made here. Given a week or two, that song could be polished to be something fantastic (or at least I hope d: ). My process always starts out very rough. If it were a sculpture, I essentially would have a chunk of stone that needs time to be chiseled to what I want. The idea doesn’t look like anything until a few features are purposefully (albeit imperfectly) chiseled. 

After having a rough idea, I always shelve the project. I don’t know why, but I shelve the project until I can “magically” stumble upon it and work on the idea again, coming from a new perspective. I can modify certain parts, tweak here and there, and then have the sculpture take a more pronounced shape. This creative process is evident in all my creative works. 

The main melody of this song and the key the song was in came about from my background in music. This minor key is "sad," but it makes the piano part that stronger. This “artistic ability” gave me the ability to start making the song. However, the way I put the song together has to come from more than an ability to make a song.  I love synth music. The music I listen to has a really deep bass beat with a slathering of electronic on it usually and I choose to put that in the music I make. I think the everyday connections I make inspire my creativity whether it be my humor or in my music.

I can ramble on forever so I’ll get to the point. This experiment gave me a reason to show my video game prototype, join a writing club, make a website from scratch, and create a song. I learned that creativity is driven by so many factors: your artistic ability and your internalization of the outside world. This internalization of the outside world is expressed through everyday creativity. This everyday creativity can be seen through humor, self-expression, and general problem solving. 

The big takeaway from this experiment is that EVERYONE has outlets to be creative. It can be your daily interactions with your friends or alone in a room making beats for hours. Creativity isn’t limited to your artistic ability and it can manifest in your work and your play. For me, talking about creativity is fascinating. There’s so much research about it, but it still has this disconnect from logic that makes it so intriguing. This disconnect from something concrete makes it hard to talk about at times, but I think it’s a conversation that we should always be having.

The world has been continually innovating for lifetimes. I don’t think people completely understand why or how sometimes. Yes we have genius artists and musicians, but many of the environments we interact with come from genius businesswoman and engineers all of which have had to be extraordinarily creative to come up with the solutions to the problems we’ve had to deal with. I hope that through what I wrote on this blog here, we can gain an appreciation for creativity outside of art.

I also hoped you enjoyed my video game prototype and songs! You should also listen to the songs I made in my **Innocent** album. I had to make an album of music in 48 hours for a video game competition. Hope you enjoyed the blog!
