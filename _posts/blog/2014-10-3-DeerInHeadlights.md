It happened. I went to my first meeting for one of the communities I decided to join. 
BPM (Beat Producers of Michigan) is a club that encourages people to create music using a variety of software and instruments.  As said in the website description *“This organization promotes the education and practice of software music production.  BPM is a fun, laid back organization where student producers can meet each other and collectively improve their abilities.  All skill levels and musical backgrounds are welcome.  We will host collaboration sessions and tutorial lessons of various difficulty levels.“* etc. etc. 

I decided my plan of attack will be to act as a fly on the wall. Just gel. Don’t make waves. 
 
I enter the room and I already approach have to ditch that tactic. There are only 8 people in the room.
“Well, s$%*t” I say to myself.
Listening to the conversations going on, I have **absolutely** no idea what anyone’s talking about.

“What are all your backgrounds?” says the leader of the club, whose name escapes me instantly.  
“Hip-Hop” “Electronic” say most people.  
“Uhh, jazz,” I say.
“Whoa cool!” is the general impression. 

“Be cool, be cool” I say to myself. I had a toe into the club finally. Maybe I can win them over by being different.
"Yea I play the saxophone," I say. This is met with more approval. I can *feel* the acceptance.

“So you’re going for Griz feel huh?” says a member.
And like that, I’m back to square 1. Deer in Headlights. Pop goes the balloon. 
Everyone’s nodding their head in agreement.  
I give the blankest look I can give.  

“Oh yea Griz, heard I a little about him,” I blatantly lie. Everyone knows I’m lying. 

And it’s obvious. Almost palpable.

But we let the moment pass and I drift farther into the background. I chip in when I can, about things I would like to see and things I want to learn. And from this more natural interaction amongst the members, I definitely see myself gelling. The leader of the group dismisses us “officially,” but then plays some of his favorite songs. He’s  a Performing Arts Technology (PAT) major and I already see the lack of knowledge and terminology I have when he speaks about the nuances of the songs he’s playing. 
Despite this, I decide to put myself in the awkward position of asking “Who’s this,” and “What’s going on.” 
Everyone knows these songs already, but being previously and (informally) labeled a beginner in music production, I saw it easier to ask stupid questions.

It seems that once people change their mindset towards you, the group dynamic shifts and expectations are adjusted. It was actually quite eye opening! 

I’m excited to see where this goes. Hopefully I can incorporate advanced techniques in my music.

I hope to make better music in a month!*
