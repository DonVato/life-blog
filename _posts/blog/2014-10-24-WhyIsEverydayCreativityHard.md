title: Why is Everyday Creativity hard?
tags: [everdaycreativity]
---

I like to think my experiment is working very well! What’s really cool about committing to artistic tasks is that I always have something to think about. I can always think about what verse, bridge, or hook I want to add to songs I’m making. I can always make new levels or add on to old ones for video game design. Writing might be more involving, but writing down quick ideas here and there always keeps the ideas fresh.

The title of this post makes no sense. Everyday creativity isn’t something you try to do; therefore, it can’t be hard. You aren’t actively trying to do routine, mundane task in inventive ways. And if you are doing something with the intent of being creative that is monotonous, you’re jumping into the realm of artistic creativity.
I decided that I’d log all my activities with an audio recorder one day. I was essentially talking to myself. I got strange looks like:

“Is he talking to himself?” 
“Why is he looking at me?” “Is he talking about me in that weird thing he’s holding?”
“Should I call the police?”

These are the thoughts I figured ran through everyone’s mind, but I was determined to figure out Everyday Creativity. 
I started the recording from my house and proceeded to walk 15 minutes down the street to my bus stop.

Surprise!

Nothing happened. The recording was probably silent for a solid 7-10 minutes on the way there. 
“Well what a waste of time.”

**BUT**

Something amazing happened in the last 3 minutes of my recording. I think it might end up being my "clincher" in the paper I'm writing about Everyday Creativity vs Artistic Creativity.
…
But I’ll save that for the podcast I’ll be posting soon!
