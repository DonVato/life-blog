*A volunteer who visited you during site visits has been struggling with service. Just finishing 3 month in-service training, they’ve been a bit confused about how to approach the rest of their service. They’ve been periodically whatsapp-ing you for advice. Today, they’re particularly flustered.*

**Passage 1**

“I can’t figure out what to do today. I’m a bit nervous about actually working in my site. I’m trying to make a game plan. Suggestions?”

“Visit your favorite Dominican’s house, that’ll give you some inspiration!” **(Go to Passage 2)**

“Stay-in and read, no need to rush into everything.” **(Go to Passage 3)**

**Passage 2**

“Great idea! My friend’s mom just made the loveliest meal! Didn’t know how much I loved rice and beans until I decided to start coming to this house LOL. She even made this bomb salad. SOOO GOOD! Uh oh. I’m starting to feel a rumbling in my stomach... Oh. No. I feel terrible all of the sudden. Crap! I don’t want to destroy this family's bathroom and make this house reek!”

“Hold it in! You can do it buddy!” **(Go to Passage 6)**

“What the heck are you waiting for? Make an escape to their bathroom ASAP!” **(Go to Passage 4)**

**Passage 3**

“Ah, this is the life. I’m about to finish this memoir I’ve been reading for ages...hold on a sec, someone’s obnoxiously calling my name outside.”

“Ignore it and continue to read for a bit.” **(Go to Passage 7)**

*Ignore this needy volunteer. Geez! You have a life too. Ahh, but you realize you're getting hungry.
You remember, you’re not yourself when you’re hungry. A snickers bar magically appears out of thin air. WHOA. You eat it. Mmm. Satisfied, you get back to the matter at hand.*
“Might be important! Answer back!” **(Go to Passage 5)**

**Passage 4**

“Whoa! I forgot how nice this bathroom was. The toilet seat’s intact. 3 ply toilet paper. What’s that? The toilet flushes? I don’t have to further embarrass myself with my subpar bucket-flushing skills!”

“Ok? I’ll leave you to continue contemplating life’s lovely wonders.” **(Go to Passage 7)**

*Ignore because your toilet's a whole in the ground and only you deserve nice things. They're returning to the living room* **(Go to Passage 5)**

**Passage 5**

“Oh no, It’s the worst kid in the neighborhood again! Great. Thought I wouldn’t have to deal with him today. Every time I try to walk away from the house, he follows me. Ooo! We’re walking by a river. Maybe that’ll distract him.”

“Haha you should “bump” into him and walk away. Maybe he’ll fall in and leave you alone!” **(Go to Passage 10)**

“Point in an ambiguous direction and when he turns, run away from where you pointed as fast as you can. In my experience, this is clearly the best and most healthy way to deal with conflict.” **(Go to Passage 7)**

**Passage 6**

“I soiled myself.”

“Umm, this is kind of getting weird, next time just run home and clean yourself
up? I suggest reading a book when you get back and forgetting all about this.” **(Go to Passage 3)**

“Oh crap! (haha get it?) Sneak into the closest bathroom while your Dona’s not looking. Or better yet, just ask to use the bathroom like a normal person.” **(Go to Passage 4)**

**Passage 7**

“Shoot! All this lollygagging and I forgot I have a charla today and looking at the time, I’m already late! What should I do?”

“Run Forest Run!” **(Go to Passage 8)**

**Passage 8**

“I made it, but **shocker**, no one showed up. Big surprise. I’m so tired of this happening all the time. GRRRR!”

”Go home and snuggle up for the rest of the day. The Peace Corps gods are not on
your side today. Try again tomorrow. Catch up on that book you’re always telling
me about!” **(Go to Passage 1)**

*You don’t see this. You’ve been napping.* **(Go to Passage 9)**

**Passage 9**

“Well, I’ve been here for 30 minutes. This is such a waste of time. Shouldn’t have all these expectations. Oh great. Two random 8 year-olds just showed up. This charla’s for adults, I can’t do anything with them! Why do they keep staring at me? GRRRR, I’m just heading home.”

“Hang out with them! You got nothing else to do.” **(Go to Passage 11)** 

*You don’t see this. You’ve been/still are napping.* **(Go to Passage 14)**

**Passage 10**

“I did it. He’s in the river.”
“...”

*Author: “Breaking the 4th wall for this one. Pushing kids in pools of water, NO BUENO! Yelling at them to leave you alone? Sure. Tattling on them so their parents can deliver swift and sweet retribution? Be my guest! Sending very evil vibes their way? Uh, maybe that’s not the healthiest solution, but you get the idea. We’re going to give you the chance to, you know, take back that terrible advice you just gave to this clueless
volunteer. You’re lucky this is a completely fictional scenario and that kid knows how to swim. Shame. Shaaame.
Anyway, redo?”*

“...Yes.” **(Go to Passage 5)**

“It was a joke! I swear!” **(Whatever, Go to Passage 5)**

“Naw, I’m straight.” **(Go to Passage 12)**

**Passage 11**

“I was a bit skeptical about your advice, but I went along with it. Didn’t do the charla, but I did remember the scrap paper I brought. We sat down and drew for a bit. It was fun! Thought I hated kids, but these ones are charming haha they tried to teach my how to read (because, of course, I’m the silly American who doesn’t know Spanish). We spent a couple hours just goofing off. Oh crap, it’s getting dark. Think I’m going to head home.” **(Go to Passage 13)**

**Passage 12**

“:o ... Umm, let’s call it a day." **(Go to Passage 1)**

**Passage 13**

“Yea! Call it a day for now. You deserve it and while it wasn’t exactly as planned, you put in effort. Pat yourself on the back. Eat some ice cream.”

**Passage 14**

*They haven’t texting you in awhile. Scrolling through the messages, you realize that the volunteer hasn’t had an easy day. You decide to initiate the conversation.*

“Hey, service is a long and hard 27 months. I can come up with all sorts of ways to sugarcoat it but I won’t. Some projects will soar. Some will fall flat. As long as you keep trying, I bet you finish your service with less regrets than if you hadn’t tried at all.”

“What? That’s terrible advice, I don’t feel any better.”**(Go to Passage 12)**

“:\ Yea. I’ll visit some homes this week and try to drum up some more people for the next charla. I’ll update you on how everything goes. Thanks” **(Go to Passage 9)**

“Hmm, maybe you’re right. I got 2 more years of this too! I should relax a bit.”**(Go to Passage 13)**
