On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me…
	~~a partridge in a pear tree.~~

# A Lamb that pees and poos to it’s heart’s glee!

TIME TO GET THE HECK OUTTA HERE!!
Christmas time is the best time to celebrate how i've ~~wasted~~ spent the vast majority of a calendar year in the DR. I finally feel like I have my ducks in a row for the first time since actually working here!

I personally find it hilarious how my measure of volunteering has changed from training to 1 year.

1. Entering country – 

>"Oh crap there’s no air-conditioning? This is the worst day of my life”

2. Meeting host family in the country’s capital (Training) -

>"OH NO! THE TOILET DOESN’T FLUSH!! I CAN’T DO THIS. Maybe my host mom won’t know it was me…"
*There's only two people who lived there, and one was me...*

3. Meeting host family in the “rural” part of the country (Still training) -

>"I HAVE MASTERED THE TOILET!! Wait, electricity’s not coming back on until tomorrow?? This is the worst day of my life"

4-	Going to your actual site where you’ll work for two years

But I mean, it’s super easy to get bogged down at the beginning. If you talk to new volunteers (and me when I first got to my site), the first thing you want to do when you arrive is leave. 

>“Yo hope, didn’t you sign up for this?”

YES. I. DID. But you really can’t have a clue what’s going to go down until Peace Corps bye felicia’s your a$$ to a place where you don’t know anyone or anything. 

But considering where I was and where I am now, I *more or less* think I was a good fit for where I was put. I run a pretty cool girl-empowerment group who’s supermotivated and loves everything we do!

Time flows fast and human emotions even faster. Your overall happiness as a volunteer can change for the better or worse in a matter of months. Here’s a calendar they often show to new volunteers then ends up being super accurate.

# *Didn't help huh?*

Video perfectly captures Peace Corps Christmas haha but there's loads of things you can do **Don’t give up!** It gets better and you’ll have a lot of fun!
And for those in America? You can make your checks payable to Hope Tambala. I hear he's a good guy.




Merry Chrismakwanzakuh!
