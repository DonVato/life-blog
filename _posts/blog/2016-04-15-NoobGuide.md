“Hope’s Declassified Guide for Peace Corps Noobs” for the DR
Being here more than half a year has basically made me an expert on all things, so here’s my list of tips for everything dominican haha jk don’t read this, ik nothing

1) Do NOT have your first ever surgery here. You do not know enough spanish to tell the doctor not to kill you. You will NOT understand what’s going on and might end up with two buttholes (that happened to me) (not the butt thing but the surgery)

2) Realize you do not know anything. This is my first time outside the USA and seriously, i can truly never guess what’s going on in someones mind. One minute you’re greeting someone, next they are pulling down their pants to take a poo.(granted i don’t think this is normal behavior anywhere, hopefully just a one-off)

3) Give up and assume you’ll get sick with some mosquito disease. With zika, malaria, and 4 types of dengue flying around, I’m hoping to get bit by a mosquito with all three and become Mosquito Man

4) Lighten up. I barely have electricity or water and then I have to go outside and talk to people who think I'm an idiot for leaving America. Lightening up especially helps with spanish convos like this

Setting-Me in front of MY house, two people approach..
Rando person: Who’s this guy?
Semi-rando person: He’s some volunteer from America
Rando: There’s black people in America?
Semi-rando: I know right? Who knew?
Follow these tips and I'm 55% sure you'll survive!
Here’s to 9 months in the Caribbean!
