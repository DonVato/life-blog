On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me…

TIME TO GET THE HECK OUTTA HERE!!
Christmas time is the best time to celebrate spending the vast majority of a calendar year in the DR. I finally feel like I have my ducks in a row for the first time since actually working.

I personally find it hilarious how your measure of volunteering changes from training to 1 year.

1. Entering country – 
>Oh crap there’s no air-conditioning? This is the worst day of my life”

2. Meeting host family in the country’s capital (Training) -
>OH NO! THE TOILET DOESN’T FLUSH!! I CAN’T DO THIS. Maybe my host mom won’t know it was me… 

3. Meeting host family in the “rural” part of the country (Still training) -
>I HAVE MASTERED THE TOILET!! Wait, electricity’s not coming back on until tomorrow?? This is the worst day of my life

4-	Going to your actual site where you’ll work for two years

But I mean, it’s super easy to get bogged down at the beginning. If you talk to new volunteers (and me when I first got to my site), is the first thing they want to do is leave. 

>“Yo hope, didn’t you sign up for this?”

YES. I. DID. But you really can’t have a clue what’s going to go down until Peace Corps bye felicia’s your a$$ in a place where you don’t know anyone.

But considering where I was and where I am now, I *more or less *think I was a good fit where I was put. I have a fun girl empowerment group who’s supermotivated and loves everything we do!

Here’s a pic of the the first round of outside toilet materials I got from a grant I wrote and got funded for!

Time flows fast and human emotions even faster. Your overall happiness as a volunteer can change for the better or worse in a matter of months. Here’s a calendar they often show to new volunteers then ends up being super accurate.

I’m coming back to the states this Christmas so I won’t have anymore grand shenanigans until New Years! **Here’s again to all the volunteers! Don’t give up! It gets better and you’ll have a lot of fun! ** 

Merry Chrismakwanzakuh!
