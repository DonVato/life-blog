Like really..don’t call me hoppy (:

I was born in Niles, Michigan and lived there very briefly. Moved to South Bend, IN and lived there until 4th grade. Fun life, diverse people (REALLY diverse…), but the ‘rents thought the school system was underwhelming.

Moved to central Indiana and basically lived there till I graduated High School. Did the whole sports thing(football), marching band(concert band, jazz band, all the bands), and after school activities gig and enjoyed a very social and lovely teenage life. Then I realized college existed during senior year and applied furiously (and surprisingly got into) the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor!

Was there for 4 years. Can’t complain. Fumbled through various majors. “History sounds good why not?”, “Oooo I love computers, computer science it is”, “oh wait, I’m premed right? Oh yea, time to take some chemistry classes.” Fumbled straight into a Chemistry major. Not my intention(chemistry is hard), but it seemed to work out(As in, I can graduate on time). Getting my B.S. in Chemistry and Informatics in May 2015. Scared out of my mind but it had to happen sooner or later.

Thennn I fumbled straight into the Peace Corps! First time ever leaving the Land of McDonalds and Chipotle. Got into the Dominican Republic program for Health and I should be here for 2 years! 

Which brings me to the purpose of my blog. I want to leave some kind of piece of me for people to read. I'm often caught up in the abstract and I like to take creative freedom with most things I do. I have a few things to show for it; I’ve made a video game, drawn a bit, made a few music tracks, and designed this website!

This blog is a representation of all my inner-workings hence "Hope Declassified." I'll have every project I work on here and write about my life. Whether you're a professional recruiter interested in what I have to offer or a pal of mine who wants to check out my new track, I hope you'll enjoy what I bring!
