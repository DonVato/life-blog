I DID IT!

I’ve made it to my 9-month mark in another country! From this being my first time **EVER** leaving America, I’m surprised I haven’t tried to swim back since. And really, this whole experience has been a world of firsts (just read the post before this). 

**Anyway…**

If I’m being completely honest, I planned to quit 3 months ago. And this was decided before coming to this program. * SHOCKER* Yea I know I know, weird right? I was one of those people who just wanted a little Caribbean adventure then “peace” out (get it?) “cue eye roll”. I would’ve seen the poverty, seen the division in classes and race, and my “voluntouring” was to be complete. One of those young 20somethings who wanted to do something different after graduation and didn’t care what it was, just to go back and have a story to tell. I wanted to have fun before I do * real* work. You know, work that pays the bills.

Welp, if I had kept that mentally I would’ve quit upon arrival to my site. This is as real as it gets. I struggle to get water daily. The roads to my village are terrible and transportation into and away from my site are unreliable the best of times and non-existent at the worst. There’s almost complete physical isolation from any English-speaking friend I have.

And why have I stayed an extra 3 months?
Simple word: Community

In the DR

Naw, this is about how I saw serious need where I lived and people seeming to care that I was gone when I left (had out-of-site training for some time). I saw kids literally run into my arms and give me a hug. I talked to families who were LEGITMATELY angry that I hadn’t visited them in a week (do I even know you that well?). Honestly, people who I thought couldn’t care less about me were talking about how they had missed me.

This affection got me thinking…what if I’d left when I planned to? When the going was the toughest? I don’t think I understand the little (and I mean little) impact I’ve made with certain people. 

Yea, it’d be cool to be remembered as  “the americano who helped us build latrines” or “the dude who gave us some cool health info” but straight up, I just want them to think that I was a cool dude to be around. I plan (and have done) a lot of that stuff already (got a grant approved* woot*), but my perspectives have shifted. I was never one of those volunteers who thought they would save the world (oh lawd no), but I never thought I’d find people who seemed to want me to be around.

Wow that sounded pathetic

By that I guess I mean it's strange to transplant myself into another place and just, i don't know, exist. I’m finding community leaders who are excited to work with me, but also know about my background. I have people my age (haha if hanging out with 15 year olds count) who have almost no overlap in my tastes, but who are interested in my life. 

I think one of the biggest Peace Corps fears run along these lines: “what they heck have I done for two years” or “is what I’ve done going to stay/matter?”
I couldn’t answer that question for anybody but myself (and heck I’m only 1/3 through my service), but at least I’ve seen an inkling of what that feeling might be down the road. Maybe I can be someone who changed mis-informed/negative opinions about americans? Maybe I’ll make one friend who remembers me when I’m gone?

I have no clue. But as I get my water (and proceed to spill it everywhere and fill another bucket), I’m starting to understand community.

And while I’m at it, I couldn’t thank my volunteer friends enough for keeping me sane. No seriously, I’d have left before 6 months if I didn’t meet the craziest family I’ll ever have. Ya’ll keep me working and having fun!
