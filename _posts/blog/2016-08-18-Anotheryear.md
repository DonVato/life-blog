WHOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! WHO MADE IT A YEAR??? THIS GUY ←
Ha, let’s take a moment to congratulate me (oh and I guess the other kids who made it too, but mostly me). We did it! Trapped on this island for 12 months with some of the craziest people I’ve met (Americans included).

What better way to celebrate living in another country than to go straight back to America! I went to the ole Midwest to celebrate (ya know, land of the free and home of obesity) and it was pretty nice and by nice I mean a complete mindcluck.
My toilet flushed and customer service exists. 

All black people do NOT speak Spanish (don't attempt to test this) and staring at hot and/or weird looking white people isn't kosher (though very, very fun). 
But more importantly I got a cake! Oh and I *guess* it was fun seeing my favorite people in the world, this half of the fool gang was documented being non-other than himself...

Not to mention this spoiled brat who licked through my sock (lotta dedication my man)

And it was weird seeing everyone walking outside. Something about catching yellow mice and hatching eggs

Frankly though, my overall trip to America was bizarre. I mean, you fantasize about how much easier your life is back home when your cleaning horse poo from your front porch, only to realize that...well…America is exactly how you left it. During your service, all you think about is how international work is too demanding and that’s why so many people quit and go home. Then you go home and realize that well, domestic life is pretty…stationary. 

I had 3 questions asked of me at home that I had absolutely no answer for.

My dad came up to me and asked me, **"So you've been gone for a year, what have you learned, is this worth putting your life on hold for two years?"**
One from a great friend of mine, **“What’s your favorite thing about the Dominican Republic?”**
And one from the second half of the fool duo (not pictured), **“When are you coming back?”**

Uhhh
I just couldn't answer those well enough for myself to tell you the truth. I've learned Spanish but that's a boring answer. I like how cheap transportation is (which was my first answer), then realized that was a complete turd of an answer. Who goes to a gorgeous island and raves about how cheap the bus was? “Dude! That free ride rocked! Totally saved $2.”

And hopefully not coming back anytime soon because I have more than a year left, but so many things can change!

Being at home was funky because it was so NORMAL. No pizazz or crazy stories. People go to work, come home, watch Netflix, eat, and the sleep. Maybe they mow their lawn.

That being the complete opposite of my life here, where I have NO schedule whatsoever and I wakeup wondering who or what will poop on my front porch.  Who knows? Maybe I’ll turn up on a Tuesday because you know people are celebrating the fact that friday's in 3 days. Who knows? Maybe that cockroach is a figment of your imagination and isn’t really in your mosquito net? 

Anyway, it’s just strange to realize how boring your life was and more so strange to realize how you can’t live this roller-coaster journey forever.  

From studying quantum chemistry and working in research labs to building corn cities and talking sex with teens..

Maybe figuring this out is what I’m supposed to get out of this?

*Quick note: I really should inform ya’ll that my front lawn/porch is 8 feet long and 3 feet wide. Am I some kind of cow shaman? GET THE HECK OUT OF MY FRONT LAWN COW! Look at this thing??? What the heck is it doing there?
