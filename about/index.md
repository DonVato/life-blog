Some people call me Hopie “pronounced Ho-pee." Dominicans call me "Po"

I was born in Niles, Michigan and lived there very briefly. Moved to South Bend, IN and lived there until 4th grade. Fun life with alot of diverse people 

Moved to central Indiana and basically lived there till I graduated High School. Fun life and not alot of diverse people, but we made it work ha. Did the whole sports thing(football), marching band(concert band, jazz band, all the bands), and after school activities gig and enjoyed a very social and lovely teenage life. Then I realized college existed during senior year and applied furiously (and surprisingly got into) the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor!

Was there for 4 years. Can’t complain. Fumbled through various majors. “History sounds good why not?”, “Oooo I love computers, computer science it is”, “oh wait, I’m premed right? Oh yea, time to take some chemistry classes.” Fumbled straight into a Chemistry major. Not my intention(chemistry is hard), but it seemed to work out(As in, I graduated in 4 years). Got my B.S. in Chemistry and Informatics in May 2015. 

Thennn I fumbled straight into the Peace Corps! First time ever leaving the Land of McDonalds and Chipotle. Currently in the Dominican Republic program for Health and I should be here for 2 years! 

Which brings me to the purpose of my blog. I want to leave some kind of piece of me for people to read. This blog is a representation of all my inner-thoughts hence "Hope Declassified." It's journal that I want share with other people.

Hope you likey!! [:
