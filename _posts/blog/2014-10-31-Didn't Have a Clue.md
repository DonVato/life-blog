title: Didn’t Have a Clue

*Warning, I haven’t checked this for grammar that well (at all). I sped wrote this one so I wouldn’t self-edit my feelings at the time! Enjoy*

WOW! My experiment is “over.” I went 30 days trying to experience life as creatively as I could! What an experience. 

I’ve gone from writing to music production and even game development for this project and it feels good to put up projects that I’ve done.

While this is supposed to be one of my last posts, I’m going to end with one of my experiences that I had this week, surprisingly on the last day of my experiment.

I go to the writing community club that I’ve joined and they were very receptive to my entrance this time. They openly welcomed me into the group and asked about what my name was and such. I hadn’t been able to go as much as I wanted, but I’m glad I was able to go one more time before this experiment ended and feel integrated in the group.

I’ll put up a quick anecdote of what happened.

We’re trying to play a writer’s version of Clue, the murder mystery game. In a hat is a mess of names, weapons, and venues that relate to a killer, the murder weapon, and the murder location.  The person running the game gets the names of everyone in the room. He/she makes a list of potential weapons and venues.  He puts all the names of the people in the room, murder weapons, and murder venues in a hat EXCEPT THREE. Those three left out of the hat are a murderer, murder weapons, and a murder venue. 

The goal of the game is to figure out what the three left out of the hat are. Each person in the room has to pick two things from the aforementioned categories from that hat and make a story for them.  If someone hears a name, weapon, or location from the categories (when everyone is telling their story), they’re crossed of your list (you’re competing with everyone else in the room). 

*Remember!* the goal of the game is to guess the items NOT given to people to make a story out of. So in essence, you have to include both items in your story. **Note this**

If there were two names, you had to think of clever ways to introduce them in the story. For a girl named Corinne, you could have used the name Cory or (rather cleverly) if you got the name Gabe, make a clever pun like “gay babe,” (someone made a really clever story out of that one). The murder weapons and locations were easy to figure out.

*DOESN’T THAT SOUND IMPOSSIBLE????*

I’ve never played Clue in my life!! I didn’t’ understand the directions and didn’t have any clue (sorry) what was going on.

What happens next is the worst series of events in my life(not really).

I picked one item out of the hat. Like I said before, you’re supposed to pick two. Strike one. 
My second item was almost given away, but my friend interjected and said I forget to pick up one. **smooth*

I did NOT write a story. I know what you’re thinking. “What the heck dude, it’s a writer’s club.” The AIM IS TO WRITE. Strike two.

But give me a break! I have no idea what’s going on, everyone’s reading their stories and I don’t know the rules. And I’m the new guy. 

*FAKE IT TO YOU MAKE IT RIGHT?? Tried and failed.* Back to square one, I literally don't know what's going on and ,not exaggeratingly, everyone is waiting for me.

“Dude you have to write a story, that’s how the game works” – says someone a little **aggressively**. They’ve been waiting for my story for 10 minutes (they skipped me when it was my turn to read and I still hadn’t written anything.”

“Ok.umm gimme me a sec”

I got two names, Corinne and Kaleb Pfifer.
I’ll give you exactly what I wrote in 10 seconds.

**“Cory what’s happening? It’s getting really hot in here,“ I say. “I don’t know man, where are we even?” says Cory. They cruise around in this swamp-ish area, brushing away trees and Peter pulls out his flute. “Might as well”**

WHAT THE HECK DOES THAT EVEN MEAN??? THERE'S NO COHERENCE IN THAT STORY??

Corinne is easy to figure out, but Pfifer was so abstract that I’m 100% sure no one got it. Do you know the story of Peter Piper? Yea the flute player in the nursery rhyme player.  I decided that Piper rhymed with Pfifer and that Peter pulling out a flute was a big enough clue. Under circumstances where I could have fleshed out an actual idea, this would’ve been gold. However, as it was presented, it’s essentially 3 guys in a swamp and one pulls a flute out of his a$$.

And to tell you the truth, I didn’t intentionally put the flute in the story. It popped in my head and I just went with it at the time. So no, I'm actually not clever at all.  It actually made no sense to me at the time.

**“sigh”**

I failed miserable in an extra-curricular club. How do you even do that? Luckily, someone was smart enough to navigate past my stupidity and also find the killer.

All in all, I think this story represents my whole experiences with this project! And (lucky enough for me) the game Clue matches the name of my blog (close enough)! I’ve been stumbling through a lot of creative works and I’ve found out that creativity comes out of the craziest of situations.  Subconsciously, I had to have linked Pfifer and Peter Piper to think of a flute. I know that sounds ridiculous, but why else would I have thought of that?

Creativity is all about navigating though obstacles whether practical or artistic. And it can come from anywhere.  If you have a gut feeling about anything, go with it. It may be utter garbage (a lot of mine are), but you don’t know if you have a diamond in the rough if you don’t dig past the rough!

I’ll be continually updating this blog here and there. I really enjoy writing about my experiences and I hope you enjoy reading about them!! Next week will be a reflective post and I'll try to post some more content! **Thanks!**
