Or more importantly, “Why Should you care?”

Throughout my 4 years at the University of Michigan, I’ve found a large amount of students feel that they’re in the “wrong field.” Creative and outgoing students in pre-medicine feel that their talents aren’t useful in the sciences.  People with high levels of “social intelligence” or strong “artistic intuition” feel that their talents are wasted on learning metabolic pathways, acid-base titrations, and quantum mechanics.
But I personally think that those same creative and outgoing people in scientific fields are the ones pushing the boundaries. Science requires diversity and therefore requires mathematically-inclined and artistically-endowed characters. 
I often find myself “feeling” that I’ve completely taken the wrong path in my education. Chemistry doesn’t allow for creativity. Being in the sciences must mean that you’re a math genius right? You probably have pi remembered right?  Right?

Wrong! Everyday creativity is equivalent to the resourcefulness, ingenuity, and cleverness you bring to the non-formal domains of creativity (everything in life that’s not art, music, poetry in a nutshell). Creative people bring their creativity to all aspects of their lives: their work, school, and play.  Your inventiveness isn’t capped in what you plan to do with your career or what you’re doing in school. 

I’m creating this blog to show that someone who plans to pursue a career in science doesn’t have to be “boring, mathematically-inclined,” or remember pi. Not that the all or even the majority of scientists fall in this category.  I want to write posts about artistic projects of course such as poetry, music production, and video game design but also show how this creativity is represented in other aspects of my life.

I plan to join 3 communities that I’ve been interested in: The Writer’s Community (artistic writing domain), Audio Engineering (music domain), and Wolverinesoft (multidisciplinary artistic domain). I plan to write about my interactions in these groups and how this creative atmosphere affects my other activities.

So back to the original question. Why should you care? Well, some of my “artistic” works might flat-out be horrible. You can get a couple laughts out of my creative talent (or lack thereof). But I want to primarily demonstrate a “creatively active” lifestyle!  I hope this blog and its posts can show that creativity can be manifested in all aspects of your life!
