JUDGE: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, today we call to trial the case of *Peace Corps Volunteer Hope v. Everyone/Everything that Annoys Him.* Does each of you swear that you will fairly weigh the case before this court, no matter how heinous the crime, so help you God?

MEMBERS OF THE JURY: I do.

JUDGE: And despite the plaintiff being, you know…*the judge* and all-around cool dude, do you swear to weigh the case without bias or prejudice?

MEMBERS OF THE JURY: I do, Your Honor.

JUDGE: Alright then. First to the stand, I summon Bling-Bling. Mr. Bling-Bling, please state your relationship to the plaintiff.

BLING-BLING: I’m your neighbor.

JUDGE: That’s “Mr. Neighbor, Your Honor” to you buster.

BLING-BLING: What? That doesn’t even make sense…

JUDGE: And here you appear before the court. Is there a reason, perhaps, you might be here Mr. Bling-Bling? Maybe a certain neighborhood group you’re affiliated with? A certain group that enjoys revving their motorcycles in front of my house at 5am blasting a song that only says one-word?

BLING-BLING: …

JUDGE: Or perhaps the very, **very** unfashionably glorified pajama bottoms, you wear? Maybe the excessive Air Jordan apparel you chose to adorn yourself with here today? HOW ABOUT THAT RIDICULOUS HAIRCUT YOU HAVE? WHAT THE HECK DUDE!? DID YOU SHAVE A PENIS ON THE SIDE OF YOUR HEAD OR SOMETHING?? IT LOOKS ATROCIOUS!!

A MEMBER OF THE JURY: **It’s a tiguere! Rush him!**

JUDGE: Order! Order in the court!

BLING-BLING: OBJECTION!

JUDGE: OVERRULED! Mr. Bling-Bling, you are dismissed from the court. And frankly, I wasn’t prepared to give you a fair trial anyway. *You. Guys. Suck.* Yea I said it! **SUCK**. *Anywhoooo,* this brings us to our next defendant. I call to the stand Mom. Mrs. Mom, can you please state your relationship to the plaintiff?

MRS.MOM: I’m your mother, Hope.

JUDGE: *Mom,* It’s Your Honor here. We went over this.

MRS.MOM: Psh, maybe if you called me every now and again I’d call you *Your Honor.*

JUDGE: Mom, I whatsapp you every week…Never mind. Mrs. Mom, do you know why you’re standing here today.

MRS.MOM: I have no idea *Your Honor.*

JUDGE: Mrs. Mom, might I remind you this is a court of law and that your light fibbing and italicized sarcasm has no place here.

MRS.MOM: Well…maybe I have a tendency to contact you a bit…much.

JUDGE: Mom…Mrs. Mom, you left the plaintiff 5 voicemails this week to complain about computer-related issues, texted him 10 multimedia messages of the aforementioned computer problem that he couldn't open, *then* sent 3 **more** text messages detailing that you simply forgot to plug-in your charger. 

MRS.MOM: Sometimes I forget where you are honey…

JUDGE: Mrs. Mom, the plaintiff has been in the Dominican Republic for 2 years! I don’t have an International Service or Data Plan! You think Peace Corps's trying to let me watch youtube videos of baby pandas sneezing 24/7 on my phone? *Mrs. Mom.* 1 time is an accident. 3 times is a coincidence. 18 attempts is a serial offense! And do you know what we do to serial offenders in this court, Mrs. Mom?

MRS.MOM: How old are you again? 24? Maybe it’s time for you to look for some places to live when you come back from Peace Corps. 

JUDGE: …The plaintiff is forced to admit that Mrs. Mom brings up some good points.

MEMBERS OF THE JURY: *aggressive side-eyes*

A MEMBER OF THE JURY: Boooo!

MRS.MOM: Who said that?

SAME MEMBER OF THE JURY: No one ma'am.

JUDGE: Mrs. Mom, you’re dismissed. Oh and when you get the chance, can you send some money pretty please?

MRS.MOM: Say it.

JUDGE: ...*I love you*. **Ahem** all right, then. I call to the stand FutureEmployer. Mr. FutureEmployer, may I call you Mr. FM?

FUTURE EMPLOYER: If it so pleases the court, Your Honor.

JUDGE: Mr. FM, that blandishment won't work here, understood? O.K.,I see here that the record shows you have an entry-level job opportunity available.

FM: I do, Your Honor.

JUDGE: And what does this job entail Mr. FM?

FM: Well, it involves the employee sitting at a computer desk located at the front of the office, greeting everyone who walks by and logging the visitor’s name in the computer log. Some job responsibilities might involve looking away from the computer. For example, a pen may drop and you might have to pick it up. But every person who has had the job has managed.

JUDGE: Thanks for that riveting explanation. Now Mr. FM, could…*say*…a teenager around 17-18 years old, manage to sit in a chair, relatively still, for a couple of hours?

FM: I suppose an 18 year old could do that Your Honor.

JUDGE: Furthermore, can you imagine a situation where an able-bodied teenager could stare at…*let’s say*…a laptop screen, for an extended period of time?

FM: I fail to see where this is going Your Honor.

JUDGE: Answer the question Mr. FM.

FM: Yes I can.

JUDGE: **SO WHYYY, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DOES THE JOB DESCRIPTION SAY I NEED A MASTER’S DEGREE WITH 5+ YEARS EXPERIENCE TO DO A JOB A SNOT-NOSED KID WHO HASN’T GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL CAN ALSO DO?**

FM: Why I…

JUDGE:  Mr. FM, you fail to realize that *entry*-level positions are for people who, you know, are *entering* the job market for the first time! I don’t need to have written a thesis on the physics regarding the optimal location to park my ass on a chair to be qualified for a job where I say *“Hi”* to people and occasionally drop my pen. Two years of living without regular water or electricity should at least get me a position as glorified hall greeter. Lock him up, bailiff! We don’t allow this gobblygoo in my court!

FM: What? You can’t lock me up! I don’t even exist yet.

A MEMBER OF THE JURY: That is a good point.

JUDGE: Well in that case, I think I’ve heard enough! My telenovela’s on anyway.
